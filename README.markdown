# PROJECT EULER
I have been attempting the Project Euler challenges as a learning exercise - primarily to enhance my problem solving skills and secondly to aid in the learning of new programming languages.

## Languages
Currently solutions are presented in

* C plus plus
* Python
* Haskell

## Installing
This repo is tested against these versions

* Ubuntu 12.04 & 11.10
* Python 2.6.6
* GCC 4.4.5
* Clang 2.9
* Glasgow Compiler 6.12.1

Call the bash script `install.bash` to get the needed software.

## Executing
Completed problems will be ran by the testing utility and double checked against the correct answer

    testing/run.py

To filter the testing add a language (or list of them) and a problem number (or list of them)

    python testing/run.py cpp 1
    python testing/run.py cpp 1 2 99 142
    python testing/run.py cpp haskell 1
    python testing/run.py cpp haskell 42 69
    python testing/run.py cpp python

## Solutions

Nothing here is groundbreaking, super minimal or extremely optimal code.
The solutions are of the most part coded upto getting the correct answer, then plopped into source control.
It's the actual completion of the problems that I'm aiming for!
